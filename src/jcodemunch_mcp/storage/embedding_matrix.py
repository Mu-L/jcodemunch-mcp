"""Process-local cache of a repository's normalised embedding matrix (#399).

Reported by @vondecron: every semantic ``search_symbols`` call re-read and
re-decoded **every** stored vector out of SQLite, then scored them with a
pure-Python cosine that recomputed the query vector's norm once per symbol. On
a 30,479-symbol index that is ~2.5 s of per-query cost that survives no matter
how warm the process is.

Two things happen here, and they are separable on purpose:

1. **The decode is paid once.** ``load()`` reads the raw float32 BLOBs, builds
   one L2-normalised matrix, and caches it against a stamp of the database's
   size + mtime (``.db`` and its ``-wal``/``-shm`` sidecars). Every write path
   on ``EmbeddingStore`` goes through ``_connect``, which bumps that stamp, and
   also calls ``invalidate()`` directly.

2. **The scoring pass is vectorised when it can be.** Vectors are stored
   pre-normalised, so cosine collapses to a dot product and the query's norm is
   hoisted out of the loop. With numpy importable that dot product is one
   ``matrix @ q``; without it, the fallback is the same pure-Python loop minus
   the two redundant norms.

⚠ **numpy is not a new dependency and must never become one.** The fallback is
load-bearing: ``_scores_python`` is exercised by its own test with numpy forced
absent. What makes the fast path nearly free is that the bundled ``local_onnx``
provider already pulls numpy in transitively via onnxruntime, so the
zero-config configuration gets it without installing anything.

⚠ **Rows are stored as ``array.array('f')``, not ``list[float]``, in the
fallback.** A list of 384 Python floats is ~8x the memory of the same 384
float32s, and this cache holds the whole table for the life of the process —
the representation that was fine to allocate per-call and throw away is not
fine to keep.

Memory is bounded two ways: at most ``_MAX_CACHED_REPOS`` repositories, and
``JCODEMUNCH_EMBED_MATRIX_CACHE=0`` disables retention entirely (matrices are
still built per call, so scoring stays fast and only the decode is re-paid).
