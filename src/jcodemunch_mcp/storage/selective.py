"""Transactional selective code snapshots. #398 Arc 2 (@rknighton).

``load_index`` runs ``SELECT * FROM symbols`` and builds the whole ``CodeIndex``
before anyone can ask it anything. Issue #370 measured what that costs at scale:
thirteen concurrent cold searches over 665,982 symbols, 7.5-11.4 minutes each,
~16.4 GiB, every caller hydrating independently. A tool that wants one symbol
body pays for the entire corpus.

This module is the narrow path. It reads repository metadata plus **all** file
rows -- the ``files`` table is bounded by file count, not symbol count, so it is
cheap and it keeps every file-level answer exact -- plus only the symbol rows the
caller named, inside one read transaction.

## The promotion boundary is the whole design

A view that answers a corpus-wide question from a partial row set is a false
absence generator, which is precisely the defect class Arc 1 shipped a release to
close. So this class does not guess and it does not fail:

  * Every field that is **exact** on a selective read is copied onto the instance
    in ``__init__``, so attribute lookup finds it normally.
  * Everything else -- ``symbols``, ``search``, ``get_callers_by_name``, the BM25
    caches, and anything added to ``CodeIndex`` in the future -- falls through to
    ``__getattr__``, which loads the full index once and delegates.

⚠ The fail-safe direction is load-bearing and it is why ``__getattr__`` is the
mechanism rather than an allow-list check at each call site. A field added to
``CodeIndex`` next year is unknown to this file, and an unknown field promotes.
The failure mode of forgetting to update this module is *slower*, never *wrong*.

``get_symbol`` is the one exception that does not promote, because it does not
have to: a miss against the preloaded set is answered by a targeted single-row
read, which is exact for any id in the database. Falling back to a query is
strictly better than either guessing absent or hydrating 665k rows.

⚠⚠ **No read on this path uses ``immutable=1``.** The trade-off that flag
accepts is channel-specific (@rknighton, 2026-08-01): on the similarity channel a
vector missed in an un-checkpointed WAL only weakens a ranking, because that
channel adds candidates and never removes any. Here the reads are exact rows, and
an invisible row is a symbol that exists and was not returned. Every connection
goes through ``generation.connect_readonly``, which reads the WAL when its
sidecar is already there, and a test fails on any hand-rolled read-only URI.
