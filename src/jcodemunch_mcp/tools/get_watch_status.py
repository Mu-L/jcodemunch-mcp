"""get_watch_status — surface watch-all state to agents.

Reports every locally-indexed repo the watch-all daemon would cover, each
repo's current reindex state (fresh / in-progress / stale / failing), and
the OS-level service status. Intended for agents to consult before relying
on a potentially stale index.

v1.106.0: also surfaces multi-process holder info. When another MCP server
(Claude Code + Cursor + Codex on the same repo) holds the watcher slot, the
``watcher_holder`` field reports {pid, client_id, started_at, age_seconds}
so the agent knows a parallel session is live and our watcher is intentionally
idle for this repo.

    replaces, `index_stale`, did not: it was
    `state.reindexing or state.stale_since is not None` over `_RepoState`,
    an in-memory per-process container that only the watcher ever writes.
    A process that never watched anything has no state, so the answer was
    False for every repo, forever, and **a repo nothing had ever looked at
    was indistinguishable from one measured fresh** (#565). Measured on the
    box that reported it: 33 repos, `any_stale` False, and the truth was 1
    stale, 2 unknown and 10 not_tracked.

    ⚠ The watcher bookkeeping is KEPT, under `watcher_flagged_stale`, which
    is what it always meant. It answers "has the watcher queued this for
    reindex in THIS process" — a real question, just not the one the name
    `index_stale` was being read for.

    ⚠ `check_freshness=False` skips the comparison and reports `unknown`
    rather than inventing `fresh`. The index side of the comparison is free —
    `indexed_at` and `git_head` ride on the discovery entry — so the whole
    added cost is one `git rev-parse` per repo. Measured over 33 repos as the
    delta against `check_freshness=False`: **1.28 s cold, 0.12 s warm** (39 vs
    4 ms/repo). The spread is the OS and git caches, not variance; the cold
    figure is the one a first call after boot pays. Both sit under the ~2.4 s
    this tool already spends on discovery and lock inspection, so the default
    is on and the opt-out is for a caller listing hundreds.
