"""Can this corpus support an absence claim at all? (#566)

``find_dead_code`` publishes ``confidence: 1.0`` and documents it as *provably
unreachable*. That is a claim about the TREE, and it was being computed from the
INDEX with nothing in between.

⚠⚠ **``search_text`` handled the identical situation correctly on the identical
index**, in the same session: ``absence_refused: true``, ``complete: false``,
and it named ``coverage.generation.git_head``. One tool refused an absence claim
it could not support and the other published the strongest available form of it.
This module is the missing half, and it deliberately reuses
``retrieval.verdict.index_coverage_meta`` and ``retrieval.freshness`` rather
than re-deriving either — a second answer to a settled question is the mechanism
this project keeps paying for.

Two causes, both of which the index already discloses and neither of which was
read:

**Stale index.** ``install_layout.py`` was reported dead at 1.0 with two live
importers, added in v1.108.313 against an index pinned at v1.108.303. The
verdict was true of the corpus it queried.

**Withheld files.** ``server.py`` is 550,036 bytes against a 512,000-byte cap,
so it is absent from the index — and it is the dispatcher that imports most of
the tree. Every module reached only from it is importer-less as a consequence of
OUR limit. ``index_folder`` already marks ``too_large`` as *withheld* rather
than an ordinary exclusion, which is exactly what makes ``complete: false``.

⚠ **UNKNOWN is not INADEQUATE, and neither is NOT APPLICABLE.** An index built
from a remote snapshot has no local tree to compare against and is not thereby
suspect; a plain unversioned folder has no revision and never will. Both are
disclosed and neither caps. What caps is a revision we should have been able to
read and could not (``unknown`` with a local source root present), a revision
that demonstrably moved (``stale``), and a file this project refused to index.
