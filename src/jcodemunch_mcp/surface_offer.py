"""A priced, opt-in offer to move an EXISTING install onto today's default surface.

``tool_surface`` is written into a config exactly once, by ``_fresh_config_content``
on a genuinely first-ever install, and is deliberately absent from
``generate_template`` so ``upgrade_config`` can never back-inject it. That is what
stops a package update silently collapsing a user's tool surface -- and it is also
why every seat created before the ``counter`` default shipped is on ``full``
permanently, with no path off it.

⚠⚠ **This module is a MESSAGE, never a migration.** Nothing here writes config,
and ``upgrade_config`` is untouched. The only thing that can move the key is a
command the user types. An offer that could apply itself would be the exact
failure mode the freeze exists to prevent.

⚠⚠ **It is fed plain data and computes nothing about visibility itself** (the
``counter.py`` rule). Both sides of the comparison are priced by the caller
through ``_build_tools_list``, which is what ``list_tools`` publishes -- a second
copy of the visibility rules would miss the counter branch's deliberate
``disabled_tools`` bypass and price a surface no client receives. That is
``_schema_tokens_for_profile``'s lesson, one axis over.

⚠ **Omit-when-clean.** ``build_offer`` returns ``None`` whenever there is nothing
to sell -- already on the target surface, silenced, or a non-positive delta. An
offer that renders with nothing behind it trains people to skip the row that
matters.
