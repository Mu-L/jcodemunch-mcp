"""``jcodemunch-mcp receipt`` — token-economy ledger.

Parses Claude Code's ``<projects-root>/**/*.jsonl`` transcripts, extracts every
``mcp__jcodemunch__*`` tool call + its result, applies per-tool savings
multipliers calibrated against the published RAG benchmarks, and prints
an honest dollar-denominated ROI ledger.

The savings model is **modeled, not measured** — token-savings is
inherently counterfactual (we can't observe what naive Read+Grep would
have cost without running it). The methodology is auditable via
``--explain``; raw per-call data is exportable via ``--export``.
