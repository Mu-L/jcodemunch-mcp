"""Unified signal fusion pipeline — Weighted Reciprocal Rank (WRR).

Merges four independent scoring channels into one ranked list:

  - **lexical**:    BM25 text relevance
  - **structural**: PageRank / import-graph centrality
  - **similarity**: Embedding cosine distance (optional)
  - **identity**:   Exact / prefix match on symbol name or qualified ID

Each channel produces a ranked list.  The final score for every symbol
that appears in *any* channel is:

    score(s) = sum( weight[c] / (k + rank(c, s)) )
               for c in channels where s appears

Where ``k`` is a smoothing constant (default 60).
