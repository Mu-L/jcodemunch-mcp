"""Lexical and vector scoring primitives shared by the retrieval path.

⚠⚠ Extracted from `tools/search_symbols.py` to break a real import cycle.
`retrieval/signal_fusion.py` reached into the TOOL for `_identity_score`,
`_cosine_similarity`, `_sym_tokens` and the BM25 constants, while
`search_symbols` imported the fusion functions back. Neither direction was
wrong: these are retrieval primitives that happened to be written inside the
first tool that needed them, so the shared half had no home of its own.

⚠ Nothing here imports `search_symbols` or `signal_fusion`, and it must stay
that way -- this is the LEAF they share. `search_symbols` re-exports every name
below, because ~30 call sites across `src/` and `tests/` still import them from
there and a move that also renames the import path is a different change.

⚠⚠ A re-export is a MONKEYPATCH TRAP: patching `search_symbols._identity_score`
does not affect callers that resolve it through this module's globals, and
nothing warns. Patch `retrieval.scoring` instead.

    Returns a high score for exact matches and a decreasing score for weaker

    Scoring:
      - Exact name match          → 50.0
      - Exact ID match            → 50.0
      - Normalised name/ID match  → 40.0

      - ID contains query segment → 20.0

    ⚠ **The 40.0 tier is the whole point of #458 and it is easy to delete by
    "simplification".** ``_tokenize`` folds case *and* strips leading
    underscores and punctuation, so a pytest fixture named ``state`` and the
    class literally named ``_State`` both reach the tokenized comparison for
    the query ``_State``. Grading them alike put them at 50.0 apiece, and the
    tie fell through to BM25, where the shorter name with a docstring won —
    a test fixture outranking the source symbol it tests, by 0.355 points out
    of ~58. A literal match must outrank a normalised one, and ``identity_type``
    must not report ``exact`` for a grade it did not measure (#440's shape).

    ⚠ **Case folding alone still counts as exact, deliberately.** ``raw_lower``
    is already case-folded and has graded exact since the channel arrived, so
    making case load-bearing would change the answer for every caller who types
    ``getuser`` for ``getUser`` — a behaviour change with no defect behind it.
    What drops to 40.0 is a match that needed *more* than case: an underscore,
    a separator, anything ``_tokenize`` removed.
