"""jcodemunch-mcp benchmark harness.

Measures real (tiktoken cl100k_base) token counts for the jcodemunch
retrieval workflow vs an "open every file" baseline on identical tasks.

Usage:
    python benchmarks/harness/run_benchmark.py [owner/repo ...]
    python benchmarks/harness/run_benchmark.py --out results.md

If no repos are given, runs against all three canonical benchmark repos:
    expressjs/express  |  fastapi/fastapi  |  gin-gonic/gin

Those repos must already be indexed (jcodemunch index_repo owner/repo).

Methodology
-----------
Baseline:   concatenate all raw source files stored in the index, count tokens.
            This is the minimum tokens a "read everything first" agent would use.

jMunch:     for each task query —
              1. call search_symbols (max_results=5)     → count JSON response tokens
              2. call get_symbol for the top 3 hits      → count each source snippet
            Total = search response + 3 × symbol source.

Tokenizer:  tiktoken cl100k_base (GPT-4 / Claude family ballpark; consistent
            across runs regardless of model).

Output:     per-task rows + per-repo summary + grand summary table (markdown).

Reference artifact
------------------
`--reference` writes `benchmarks/jcm_reference.json`: the machine-readable
jCodeMunch side of every comparison harness in this directory. The comparison
harnesses (`run_rag_baseline.py`, `run_odysseus_compare.py`) READ that file
instead of carrying hand-typed constants, and refuse to print a ratio for a
repo the artifact does not cover.

Each repo entry records the index state it was measured against (file count,
baseline tokens). A comparison harness that measures a different index state
labels the row cross-run rather than dividing a fresh number by a stale one.

    Two questions a published benchmark number has to be able to answer, and
    neither was recorded before v1.108.222:

    1. **Which upstream tree?** `index_repo` has no ref parameter — it fetches
       whatever the default branch points at today — so a run reproduces a
       published number only by accident. The pin lives in `tasks.json` and is
       checked here against the index's own `git_head`.
    2. **Was all of it indexed?** The file cap silently truncates. The
       `fastapi/fastapi` index behind every number published through
       v1.108.221 held 1,000 of 1,182 eligible files and said so nowhere; its
       coverage record was `{}`. (What the cap dropped turned out to be 182
       empty `__init__.py` files worth zero tokens, so the headline never moved
       — but that was discovered by measuring it, not by anything the artifact
       could tell you.)

    `complete` is tri-state on purpose. An index with no coverage record has
    not been found complete; it has not been measured. Collapsing that to
    `False` invents a defect, and collapsing it to `True` is the false-absence
    shape this project keeps closing.

    * **Matching is case-insensitive substring on ANY term** (``rg -i
