"""Build the grounded pilot corpus. Run AFTER `predicate.py` was registered.

Each case is bound to a real repository at the SHA published in
`benchmarks/tasks.json`, so the pilot is reproducible by anyone who checks the
same commits out.

    Class S -- target is a real indexed SYMBOL.        gold = search_symbols
    Class T -- target is a real string LITERAL that
               is not any symbol's name.               gold = search_text

⚠⚠ **Gold is fixed by which kind of object the case was built from, and the
predicate never sees the target.** That is the only thing keeping this from
being a tautology: the predicate must recover the class from the task text plus
the repository's symbol vocabulary.

⚠⚠ **THE CONFOUND IS REAL AND IS MEASURED RATHER THAN ENGINEERED AWAY.**
Class-S tasks come from docstrings, which are written in the same vocabulary as
the symbol names around them. Class-T tasks come from user-facing message
strings, which are prose. So the predicate can look good for a reason that is an
artifact of where the text came from rather than a real inference. The runner
reports the separation with and without each target's OWN name parts in the
vocabulary, which is what tells those two apart.

Seeded and deterministic: same checkouts in, same cases out.
