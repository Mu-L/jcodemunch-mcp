"""Power for the paired SWE-bench arm comparison, by simulation.

Practice 4: never hand-type a benchmark number. The table in PROTOCOL.md is
printed by this script; if the design changes, re-run it rather than editing
the table.

⚠ The `contested` parameter is an ASSUMPTION, not a measurement. It is the
fraction of instances where the two arms could plausibly disagree at all; the
rest are solved-by-both or solved-by-neither regardless of tooling. Replacing
it with a measured value is one of the four things the 50-instance pilot exists
to find out.
