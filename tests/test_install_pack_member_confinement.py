"""A Starter Pack archive member must not write outside the install directory.

Issue #447, reported by @elfrost with a working fix in PR #443 that we could not
merge for CLA reasons. `install-pack`'s pre-scan rejected a leading separator and
`..` anywhere in the member name, which is necessary and not sufficient: a member
named `C:/Windows/Temp/evil.txt` carries neither, and `base / relative` with an
absolute `relative` DISCARDS `base`. The archive is served over TLS from a host
we control, so this is a compromise-amplifier rather than a drive-by — and that
is exactly the class where the guard has to hold anyway.

⚠ **The assertion here is CONFINEMENT, never that a particular string is
refused.** `C:/Windows/Temp/evil.txt` is absolute on Windows and an ordinary
relative name on Linux and macOS, where extracting it under the base is correct.
Pinning the refusal would encode platform trivia as if it were a security
property; pinning "nothing appeared outside the base" is the property.
