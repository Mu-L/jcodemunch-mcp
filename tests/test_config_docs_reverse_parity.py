"""Every `DEFAULTS` key is documented, or is named here as internal.

`tests/test_docs_config_parity.py` checks the one direction (a documented key
exists). This is the other: a key that exists is documented in
CONFIGURATION.md or CLI-AND-ENV.md, by name or by its env-var spelling, or it
is in INTERNAL_KEYS with a reason. The 16 names below were undocumented
everywhere on 2026-09-03 (docs/standard/DISCOVERY.md section 7); listing
them is a FINDING (docs/harness/FINDINGS.md F-03), not an endorsement.
Removing a name from this list is the direction the list may move.
