"""What the client was told and what the telemetry row records must agree.

#551 (@rknighton): `_call_tool_impl` tracked its outcome in a local flag
initialised to ``True``, and three of its four error exits never cleared it.
Schema-validation rejections, the ``search_text`` argument guard and a
front-door relay of a child's refusal all returned ``isError=True`` to the
client and wrote ``ok=1`` to ``tool_calls`` -- a 0% error rate over calls the
client watched fail.

#552 (@rknighton): the Counter's ``order`` gate returned a body whose only key
was ``error`` and did not set ``isError`` at all, so a client branching on the
flag v1.108.74 added for exactly that purpose read a refusal as a success.

⚠ Both are guarded here as PROPERTIES, not as the reported sites. The reported
counts were three exits and two gates; the real counts were more in both cases,
and a fifth exit with the identical shape could not be made to fire in the
reporter's harness at all. A test naming the sites would pass while the next one
is added.
