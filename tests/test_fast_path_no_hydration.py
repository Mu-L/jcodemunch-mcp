"""The watcher fast path answers its questions from metadata, not from symbols.

⚠⚠ `index_folder`'s fast path opened with an unconditional
``store.load_index(owner, repo_name)  # always load base for branch check`` --
inside the block whose entire purpose is to avoid loading the index, and three
lines above the ``use_memory_hash_cache`` flag that exists to make the store's
hashes unnecessary. Reported as part of #557 (@Ticki84).

⚠ Everything that path asks of the base index is METADATA: ``branch``,
``git_head``, ``file_hashes``, ``has_source_file``, and the two re-parse stamps
``parser_generation`` / ``racket_config_digest``. Measured on this repo's own
index, cold: 0.172 s for 13,906 symbol rows versus under a millisecond and ZERO
symbol rows for the selective read.

⚠⚠ These tests assert the OUTCOME -- that nothing on the path promotes the view
-- rather than the mechanism. A test that asserted "``open_selective`` is
called" would pass while a newly added ``existing_index.symbols`` quietly
hydrated the whole corpus behind it, which is the only failure worth catching
here (Practice 9).
