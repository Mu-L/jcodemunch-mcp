"""Every surface that declares our license must name the same identifier.

#517 (@marcelruhf) switched packaging metadata to a PEP 639 expression so a
commercial user could allowlist the license BY IDENTIFIER rather than by the
full LICENSE text PyPI was publishing as `info.license`. That fixed the surface
they hit and left two others declaring `LicenseRef-Dual-Use` — no product
prefix, no version — so an allowlist keyed on the identifier still needed two
entries. Same defect as the one that was fixed, one surface over.

The version suffix is deliberate: LICENSE 1.2 must produce a NEW identifier, so
consent to 1.1's terms is not silently inherited by terms nobody read. That only
holds if the suffix tracks the file, which is the second assertion here.
