"""The shared result cache must not hand out the object it is holding (#572).

Reported by @rknighton with a standard-library reproduction, one issue after
the ``KeyError: '_meta'`` crash of #570 -- and the point of the report is that
the crash was the loud case. ``cache_put`` stored the caller's dict and
``cache_get`` returned that same dict, so the dispatcher's DISPLAY step edited
the cache:

* ``server.py`` deletes ``_meta`` when ``meta_fields`` is ``[]`` (the shipped
  default) or when a call passes ``suppress_meta``;
* it replaces ``_meta`` with a subset for any other ``meta_fields``;
* and it writes budget / agent-selector fields INTO ``_meta``.

⚠⚠ **The reachable-only-on-a-default-config framing is too narrow, and the
widening is this file's own finding.** ``suppress_meta`` is a per-CALL
argument, so on a machine with ordinary ``meta_fields`` a single call passing
it empties the shared entry, and the next caller -- who asked for metadata --
is served the damage. Measured pre-fix on that exact sequence: the second call
came back with an empty ``_meta``.

⚠ **The window is the MISS path, not the hit path**, which is the other
correction the report invites. Both cached tools already do
``result = dict(cached)`` and rebuild ``_meta`` on a hit, so a repeat call
survives; it is the call that FILLS the cache that returns the stored object
to a dispatcher that then edits it. That is why a two-call reproduction shows
the crash and a two-call reproduction of the quiet cases shows nothing.

⚠⚠ **Fixed in the CACHE, not at the two call sites**, and that is the whole
argument of the report: ``search_symbols`` keeps a separate cache and has
already paid for this twice in its own ``_result_cache_get`` -- #377 item 3
for ``_meta.verdict``, then #404 (also @rknighton) for the rows -- and neither
fix reached the shared one. A third per-consumer patch leaves the trap armed
for the tool written next. Standing lesson: *we fix the reported call site and
leave the mechanism.*
