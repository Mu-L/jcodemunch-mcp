"""Every `index_folder` knob the watcher names must reach `index_folder`.

⚠⚠ `context_providers` existed on `index_folder` and had **no route from the
watcher at any layer** — no CLI flag, and not a parameter of `watch_folders`,
`WatcherManager`, `_watch_single` or `_initial_index`. Its three neighbours
(`use_ai_summaries`, `follow_symlinks`, `extra_ignore_patterns`) were threaded
end to end, so nothing looked wrong at any single site (#558, surfaced by
@Ticki84 in #557 when they tried to hold it fixed across a comparison and
could not).

⚠ These are PROPERTIES over the signatures, deliberately not a list of four
names. A hand-written roster would have had the same hole the next time a knob
is added, which is the whole reason the gap survived — see
[[a-set-cannot-count]] for the sibling shape.
