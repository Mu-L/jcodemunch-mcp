"""The route-recall artifacts must reflect the code that is checked in.

⚠⚠ **They did not, and nobody could have noticed.** On 2026-08-21 the committed
`results.json` reported `route@1 69.5 / @3 88.1`; a fresh run of the same harness
against the same corpus returned `71.2 / 86.4`. Two queries had moved — one
gained rank 1, one fell out of the top 3 entirely — because the catalog's
descriptions drifted under a frozen artifact. `catalog_actions` was unchanged at
91, so nothing about the corpus or the catalog SIZE gave the drift away.

That matters beyond tidiness: **`CLAUDE.md` cites `route@1 69.5%` as the evidence
that catalog-moratorium condition 1 is met.** The verdict did not change (71.2 is
still above the 60% bar), but the cited number was a fact about a tree that no
longer existed. Maintenance Practice 4 says never hand-type a benchmark number;
this is the same failure one level up — the artifact itself went stale, and a
number read out of it is as wrong as one typed by hand.

Both harnesses run in about a second, so there is no reason for this to be
checked by remembering.

Failure here means re-run and commit the artifact, NOT edit the expectation:

    PYTHONPATH=src python benchmarks/route_recall/run_route_recall.py --write
    PYTHONPATH=src python benchmarks/route_recall/run_emitted_task.py --write

⚠ A red here on a PR that only touched tool descriptions is the signal working.
Descriptions are the router's input; changing them changes routing, and the
moratorium conditions are stated over these exact numbers.
