"""The `config` reporter must show every indexing limit it honours (#375).

v1.108.193 gave the per-file cap a config key (`max_file_size`) and an env var
(`JCODEMUNCH_MAX_FILE_SIZE`), and the resolver honoured both. The `config`
command did not print it. Its two siblings were listed, so the omission read as
"this limit does not exist" rather than "this limit is not shown", and the only
way to read the effective value was to import `security` and call the resolver
by hand — which is what @dkiaulakis did, concluding from a bare REPL (no
`load_config()`) that the env route was dead. It was not; it was invisible.

The guard below is deliberately written against the SET of limits rather than
against `max_file_size` alone: the defect class is "a limit gains a route and
the reporter is not updated", and pinning one key would not catch the next one.
